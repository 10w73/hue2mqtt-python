# Hue2MQTT

Python Hue to MQTT Bridge

## What and Why?

Hue2MQTT lets you control your Hue setup using MQTT and publishes the current state in real-time.

- Python 3.8+ with type hints and asyncio
- Uses the excellent [aiohue](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/aiohue) library to communicate with Hue.
- Control your lights using MQTT
- Receive live events (i.e button pushes, motion sensors) in real-time.
- No polling your Hue Bridge for changes
- IPv6 Support

## Configuration

Hue2MQTT is configured using `hue2mqtt.toml`.

```toml
# Hue2MQTT Default Config File

[mqtt]
host = "::1"
port = 1883
enable_tls = false
force_protocol_version_3_1 = true

topic_prefix = "hue2mqtt"

[hue]
ip = "192.0.2.2"  # or IPv6: "[2001:db0::1]"
username = "some secret here"
```

If you do not know the username for your bridge, find it using `hue2mqtt --discover`.
